  <h3>

  </h3>
  <p class ="text-align-center">
    I am from Houston Texas and graduated from Jersey Village Highschool.
    In high school, I participated in the school concert and marching bands,
    and becaming a section leader in the marching band. I took a Java programming
    course in high school and again at A&M to make sure I had a firm grasp on the
    language.

    In college I took more courses in computer programming.  Through these
    courses, I now have a basic understanding of C++ and Matlab. In addition,
    I am starting to learn HTML. I am involved in Student Bonfire, the Society
    of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and Texas A&M Shotokan Karate. I am
    currently working as a student technician with the Texas A&M Department of
    Student Affairs.
